            <h1>About Me & Your First-Year Journey!</h1>
            <p>Hi there, I'm <strong>Shravya N Bhat</strong>, a 2nd Year Information Science and Engineering student at <strong>NMAMIT</strong>. My first year was an incredibly enriching experience of learning, growth, and making unforgettable memories.</p>

            <p class="highlight">I was actively involved, serving as a <strong>Class Representative (CR)</strong>, which honed my leadership and communication skills through coordinating with classmates and faculty. Beyond academics, I've boosted my skills with online courses and an <strong>AIC Internship</strong>, and I seized every opportunity to showcase my talents in singing and dancing.</p>

            <h2>My Advice for Your First Year:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academics:</strong>Strive to avoid backlogs and maintain a good CGPA; it's achievable. If you face challenges, clear exams in the summer semester.</li>
                <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong>While a mentor is assigned, proactively seek guidance from knowledgeable lecturers, seniors, or industry experts to keep learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Well-being & Growth:</strong> Prioritize your physical and mental health, strategize, and explore interests to find what brings you satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> I was shortlisted for <strong>Reliance Foundation Undergraduate</strong>. Remember to <strong>apply for all scholarships</strong> you qualify for â€“ it can significantly ease the financial burden!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="resources">This guide has been compiled with the aim of simplifying your first year. Here, you'll find comprehensive <strong>notes, question banks, and previous year's question papers</strong>. Many of the popular PDFs named <strong>'ISE-I'</strong> were my contribution to help peers. For even more support, be sure to explore the <strong>Student Hub</strong>!</p>

                <h2>Making the Most of Your First Year:</h2>
                <p>Your first year is the <strong>best time</strong> to build a <strong>strong foundation</strong>. Embrace every moment, explore new horizons (<strong>both technical and cultural</strong>), and solidify your basics. Participate in college events, including the Techno-Cultural Fest - <strong>Incridea</strong>, and don't hesitate to volunteer; seniors are always ready to guide you. For a peaceful break, explore <strong>Sanmathi Park</strong> or <strong>B.C. Alva</strong>.</p>
                <p class="personal-touch"><strong>Networking, communication, and diverse skill development are key.</strong><br>Engage with peers, seniors, and faculty. Make the most of this exciting chapter!</p>
